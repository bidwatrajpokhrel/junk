<marquee>whoa what the fuck is this text doing? </marquee> <br>
 <hr>

<h2> <center> anyways, here's something to read for you atm: </center></h2>

<p>
    1.	Everyone has a voice on the internet and that is part of the reason why it is so important. The internet liberates people regardless of their personal backgrounds. Social media platforms like twitter and reddit are great places to share ideas and have discussions regarding those ideas.
</p>
<p>
    2.	Not all people see the world in the same way. Diversity in thought and communicating each other’s thought and feeling about various topics is what makes humans interesting.
</p>
<p>
    3.	It is every human’s desire to be heard and understood by each other. We are quite fond of sharing our ideas and views to the world in hopes of people understanding our perspective.
</p>
<p>
    4.	Among others, some topics ‘seem’ to divide the society into two. From whether we should eat meat or not, to whether “black lives matter” is an appropriate slogan, in things big and small, there can be seen people online arguing about things.
</p>
<p>
    5.	The arguments that we see online are not anything like the typical arguments that you see in real life. Tea shops and cafes and family gatherings, all have seen their fair share of arguments; some are peaceful, and ideas are merely shared without anyone raising their voices to one another; while some are more fierce, like when drunk uncle Sammy calls grandpa Patty an ignorant old hippie, just because his political thoughts don’t align with his. On twitter, arguments are more like the later one, except if it had been exercising on how to be more violent for years and years. One-person trashing another, then another person trashing another. It is a complete shit show.  Even when people have good arguments, people do not leave out name calling.
</p>
<p>
    6.	The culture of belittling other people is not one to be proud of. If you think someone has a different opinion as you, and especially if you think that they are in the wrong, you want to convince them. But to do so, it is important to realize that the words you use and the tone of how you say things matter a lot when having arguments. If you think the other person is wrong, you can be sure that if the person is just as passionate about you are on their beliefs, he thinks you wrong too. In this situation, the last thing that would help you two is to belittle each other for what the other party thinks. You should stop insulting them.
</p>
<p>
    7.	Whenever we see someone with a different opinion, we don’t see things for what they are. Most often we fall into a trap that most people fall into. We associate opinions with personalities. And even within ourselves we do that. We tend to associate ourselves and others with different opinions, and act as if changing someone’s (or our own) opinion is impossible. But that is simply not true. We are not our opinions and our opinions are subject to change. Simply becoming aware of this will be a breakthrough.
</p>
<p>
    8.	Instead of belittling people for the ideas that they possess, if you think that you are right about a certain topic, it is important to first and foremost realize that their ideas are subject to change, just like yours. Listen to what they have to say, understand what they are saying and understand why they are saying it. Then, present your arguments with whatever facts and findings you have.
</p>
<p>
    9.	Simply presenting facts and findings is not enough though. Humans are emotional creatures. We associate our values to certain emotions; hence we must approach arguments with empathy and kindness rather than rage and anger. Imagine this, a dog is coming at you with its snout squeezed, teeth showing and is growling at you. Would you be kind towards the dog and pat him? Of course not. Your fight or flight kicks in and you either run or stand to beat the beast up. It’s the same with arguments, if you make the other person’s opinions feel threatened, they won’t listen to you. They will only focus on arguing with you. You will not be able to get through to them because they will put their guards up.
</p>
<p>
    10.	What we must do instead is be kind and polite. Imagine if the person was one of your best friends and they say something that isn’t nice. Do what you would do in that situation. Politely talk to them and make them understand what you are trying to say whilst also listening to their arguments.
</p>
<p>
    11.	Another thing is that we should all be okay with the fact that everyone has their own opinion. And that is okay. You might fail to ever make someone see the world the way you do. And that is fine. You two can still be friends. If everyone shared the same ideas, there would really be nothing to talk about and the world would be a boring place to live.
</p>
<p>
    Thanks, bye.
